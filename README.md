# ðŸ¤Ÿ ASL Sign Language Recognition

This project recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets (Aâ€“Z) using deep learning with **EfficientNetB0**, and deploys a **real-time detection app** using **Streamlit + OpenCV** with speech output.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Train ASL alphabet recognition model with EfficientNetB0 (`model_train.py`)
- Real-time hand gesture recognition (`asl.py`)
- Text-to-Speech support
- Saved trained models (`.keras`)
- Class label mappings (`class_labels.json`)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

## ðŸ›  Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/asl-sign-language.git
cd asl-sign-language
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸŽ® Usage
### Train Model
```bash
python model_train.py
```

### Run Real-time Detection
```bash
streamlit run asl.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Accuracy and loss curves saved in `training_history.png`
- Real-time predictions with confidence scores
